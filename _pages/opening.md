##Two Fully funded Ph.D. positions in Baylor University
The Secured and Dependable Intelligent Systems (SeDIS) Lab at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of Baylor University, Waco, Texas, USA, invites highly motivated students
with backgrounds in formal verification, cybersecurity, and/or machine learning to apply for two funded Ph.D. positions available for Spring 2025 under the supervision of Dr. Ernest Bonnah. The
research projects will explore novel formal verification, security, and machine learning techniques to guarantee and enhance safety, quality of service, and security in intelligent autonomous systems,
the internet of autonomous things, and edge computing paradigms.

##Responsibilities
The major responsibilities of successful applicants include conducting doctoral research and coursework. Ph.D. students will be required to identify novel research directions and design the
appropriate computational experiments to answer key research questions. In this regard, students will perform world-class research in edge/network privacy and security, or formal verification of
autonomous systems. Lastly, Ph.D. students will be required to effectively communicate the results of their research findings, both verbally and in writing.

##Requirements
1. Good academic results in B.Sc./M.Sc. with a Computer Science/Engineering major. Knowledge of formal verification, automata theory, and cybersecurity is required.
2. Strong programming skills (C/C++, Python) are required. A good understanding of graph theory, dynamic programming, machine learning, and optimization techniques is an added
advantage.
3. GRE with a strong quantitative score is a plus.
   
Successful applicants will receive financial support as research assistants in the form of full tuition waivers with monthly stipends. Candidates with expertise and interests in the areas above are
encouraged to apply.

Interested candidates are encouraged to directly contact Dr. Ernest Bonnah (ernest_bonnah@baylor.edu) with the subject line â€œPh.D. Position in SeDIS." The email should
include (1) a description of your interest in the specific research topic and demonstrate how you meet the requirements above, and (2) a CV, including a list of publications (if any).
