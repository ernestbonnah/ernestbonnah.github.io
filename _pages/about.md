<hr>
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Baylor University, Waco, Texas. I direct the Secured and Dependable Intelligent Systems (SeDIS) Laboratory. Before joining Baylor University, I was a member of the Dependable Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory at the University of Missouri-Columbia, under the supervision of Prof. Khaza Anuarul Hoque.  

Click around to learn more about my <a href="https://ernestbonnah.github.io/research/">research interests</a>, read some of my <a href="https://ernestbonnah.github.io/publications/">publications</a>, or <a href="https://erenstbonnah.github.io/opening/">vacancies</a> in my research lab.

<b>Research Interests</b> 

My research goal is to investigate and develop various theories, methods and tools to guarantee safety, security and quality of service in complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) and IoT devices by leveraging techniques from formal methods, blockchain, cyber security, and machine learning.
