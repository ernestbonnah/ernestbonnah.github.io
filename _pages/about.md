I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Baylor University, Waco, Texas. I direct the Secured and Dependable Intelligent Systems (SeDIS) Laboratory. Before joining Baylor University, I was a member of the Dependable Cyber-Physical Systems (DCPS) Laboratory at the University of Missouri-Columbia, under the supervision of Prof. Khaza Anuarul Hoque. Prior to joining the DCPS Lab, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Distributed Computing Laboratory at the Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Proviince, P.R. China under the supervision of Prof. Ju Shiguang.
