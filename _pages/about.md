I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Baylor University, Waco, Texas. I direct the Secured and Dependable Intelligent Systems (SeDIS) Laboratory. Before joining Baylor University, I was a member of the Dependable Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory at the University of Missouri-Columbia, under the supervision of Prof. Khaza Anuarul Hoque.
